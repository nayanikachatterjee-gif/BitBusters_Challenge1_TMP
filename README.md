🔍 Key Insights & Findings:

Our analysis of the OmniMart dataset led to the following key insights:

Overall Business Performance: Sales show strong seasonality — January peaks at $6.54M while February dips to $6.15M, and mid-week (Wed–Thu) drives the highest daily revenue.

Product & Category Performance: Electronics + Grocery dominate both volume and spend, with Electronics acting as the central “hub” product, strongly cross-linked to other categories like Books and Clothing. Electronics is the undisputed top category by purchase volume (70,944), followed by Grocery as a strong second (66,552).

Customer Insights: Churn risk is concentrated in at-risk loyalists (high frequency but inactive for 200+ days), signaling an urgent need for win-back campaigns and loyalty fixes.

For a more detailed breakdown, please refer to our full analysis in the Jupyter Notebook and the accompanying presentation.
